PHP-Link-Preview
================
Simple PHP image preview grabber. Just enter in the page url and it will pickup all the images that match the DOM query.

Use in conjunction with jQuery and one can quickly make a image preview service like Pinterest, or Facebook's page preview. With some extras you could also pickup page littles, etc. just by modifying the construct.
